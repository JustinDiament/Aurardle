Aurardle is a Wordle-inspired game where the goal is to guess a Northeastern Huskies athlete in 6 tries or less.

After each guess, you will be told how close you are to guessing the athlete in a number of different categories, 
similar to other sports Wordle games like MLB's WARdle and NBA's Poetl. 

Aurardle is named after Northeastern women's hockey player Chloe Aurard.
